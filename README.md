## Create a RomCom Cover
This website allows you to generate a random romcom book cover or create one of your own.

#### Description
Use our preloaded cover images, titles, and descriptive romantic words to randomly generate a new and exciting book cover of your own. Alternatively, you can choose your own title and descriptions, uploading an image of your choice. When you’ve found a perfect cover, save it along with your other favorites.

### Getting Started

#### Dependencies
The project is ready to go when you are. Open it in your browser, and get ready to make a book.

#### Execution
	#####Home Page
On the home page, you’ll see several buttons to help you navigate.
Clicking on the **Show New Random Cover** will generate a random cover from our list of saved covers, titles, and descriptions.
If you like the cover displayed on this home page, clicking the **Save Cover** button will save it to a new page for you to view again later.
When you’re ready to view these saved covers, click the **View Saved Covers**.
Then, if you’d like to make a cover of your own, navigate to the **Make Your Own Cover**.
	#####View Saved Covers
When you click your **View Saved Covers** button, you’ll see every cover you’ve saved up to this point.
You can remove a saved cover by double clicking on the image.
From here, you can go **Home** or make your own cover.
	#####Make Your Own Cover
To make your own cover, type the title and descriptors of your choice into the respective input fields.
You can choose an image of your choice, and copy the address into the cover field.
Congratulations, you’ve made your own new cover! You can save it if you’d like and view it in your saved covers.

### Future Additions
	In the future, we hope to do the following:
Add the ability to drag your favorite covers around to change the order.
Allow a single click to increase the size of a specific saved cover.
